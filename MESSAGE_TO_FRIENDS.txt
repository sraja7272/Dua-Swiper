Hey! 👋 I made a cool app called "Duas Swiper" - it's like Tinder but for duas! 😄

Here's how it works:
1. Sign in with your Google account
2. Create a Google Spreadsheet with two columns: one with "name" in the title and one with "dua" in the title
3. Paste your spreadsheet URL into the app
4. Swipe through your duas like cards! Swipe left/right on mobile or use arrow buttons on desktop

The app is completely private - all your data stays in your browser, nothing gets stored on any server.

To install it as an app on your phone (PWA):
📱 iPhone: Open the site in Safari, tap the Share button, then "Add to Home Screen"
🤖 Android: Open the site in Chrome, tap the menu (3 dots), then "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen"

Let me know what you think! 🚀
